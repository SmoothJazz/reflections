When you iniitalize a
repository it creates the
.git file that tracks the
history of all files in the 
repository, and that's 
kind of important to
have for a version 
control system

The staging area is different
as it offers somewhat of a 
buffer zone before you submit 
your commits, and allows you to
bundle files together that are
all related to one change
instead of committing them all
one by one. 

You can use the staging area 
to compare between versions
and check if you actually 
want to commit something.

Different branches are useful
for when you want to create
different versions of a project
without running the risk of 
introducing fatal bugs to
your existing code

The diagrams change the way
you visualize it by making
the repository a non-linear
group of nodes instead of
a completely linear group
of directories.

Merging two branches together
combines two different versions
of the code into one, uniting all
their features.

The Pros of Git's automatic
merging feature is that it's
infinitely easier than going
through possibely thousands
of lines of code to merge
everything manually, even if
there is the chance of running
into a merge conflict
