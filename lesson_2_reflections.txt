When you iniitalize a
repository it creates the
.git file that tracks the
history of all files in the 
repository, and that's 
kind of important to
have for a version 
control system

The staging area is different
as it offers somewhat of a 
buffer zone before you submit 
your commits, and allows you to
bundle files together that are
all related to one change
instead of committing them all
one by one.
