It'd be a good idea to use a
remote repository if you want
to work across multiple computers
or if you're working on a project
with multiple people.

Automatically pulling changes
from git may overwrite changes
on your local version of the
repository.

A fork is git making a clone of
another repository that's on their
servers, under your name so that
you can freely modify those files
as your own. A branch is within the
same repo and a clone is just a copy
of another repository.
