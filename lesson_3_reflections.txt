It'd be a good idea to use a
remote repository if you want
to work across multiple computers
or if you're working on a project
with multiple people.

Automatically pulling changes
from git may overwrite changes
on your local version of the
repository.

A fork is git making a clone of
another repository that's on their
servers, under your name so that
you can freely modify those files
as your own. A branch is within the
same repo and a clone is just a copy
of another repository.

The benefit of having a copy of the 
last known state of the remote stored
locally is that it gives you somewhat
of a 'control' of what the last bit
of working code looked like.

oh my god it would be infinitely easier
to collaborate with git/github, no 
question about it. The automated merge
with conflict detection is enough
reason alone to use it.
