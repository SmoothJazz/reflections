Viewing a diff of two files
makes it easier to spot bugs
especially if you use short lines
because diff only shows the
lines that have changed 
and highlights them
it's much easier
than just having the two files
side by side

If you have access to the old
versions of a file then it's
always readily available to
restore if something goes 
wrong, and can be checked 
against to find bugs in the
new code

Creating commits manually makes
them more meaningful, but is prone
to user error, whereas automatic
commits aren't prone to user error
the commits themselves may not be
all that useful

The reason some VCS's allow saving
multiple files in one commit is that
they cater to writing code. where
each file in a project is likely 
to be related, but not every file
you ever make on Docs is likely to
related

You can use git log and git diff
to find past versions where
specific feature were added
and use diff to see exactly 
what's changed between files

You'll be more confident in making
commit's because if it introduces
an error you can very easily
just revert back to an older
state of the code

Now that the workspace is set
up it'll hopefully start making 
me more efficient at writing
code for projects.
